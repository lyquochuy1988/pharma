                                        Ok we found our guy unresponsive, and
                                        you gave him 5 cycles of CPR. Just as a
                                        reminder, 1 cycle of CPR means 30 chest
                                        compressions followed by 2 breaths. So
                                        we give him five cycles of that. Start
                                        with the compressions and then open the
                                        airway with a head tilt chin lift and
                                        give the 2 breaths. Each breath is 5-6
                                        seconds.

                                        IV line, and puts an oxygen mask on the
                                        patient and sends off blood to the lab.
                                        Remember , each chest compression takes
                                        the chest down around 2-2.4 inches.
                                        Remember, any pauses during CPR should
                                        be less than 10 seconds. Use one of
                                        these pauses to insert the Endotracheal
                                        tube.

                                            Quick reminder here: If you are
                                            using a monophasic debrilllator, all
                                            shocks are at 360 joules. Biphasic
                                            debrillators have device specific
                                            guidelines, however, there may not
                                            be time to figure that out during a
                                            code, so if it is a Biphasic
                                            debrillator, all shocks are at 200
                                            Joules, or you could start at
                                            120-200 J and escalate to 200, 300,
                                            360. Biphasic means that the
                                            electrical current travels in both
                                            directions, ie it travels from one
                                            paddle to the other paddle in one
                                            direction, and then it flows back to
                                            the first paddle in the opposite
                                            direction. Biphasic needs less
                                            energy, and less chances of burns,
                                            and less damage to the heart.
